## Installation

### Creating a Virtual Environment

#### Using Conda

If you prefer Conda as your package manager:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to your project directory.

3. Run the following command to create a new Conda environment:

    ```bash
    conda create --name your_env_name python=3.12
    ```
    Replace `your_env_name` with the desired name for your environment e.g. week0 and `3.12` with your preferred Python version.

4. Activate the environment:

    ```bash
    conda activate your_env_name
    ```

#### Using Virtualenv

If you prefer using `venv`, Python's built-in virtual environment module:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to your project directory.

3. Run the following command to create a new virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv your_env_name
    ```

    Replace `your_env_name` with the desired name for your environment.

4. Activate the environment:

    - On Windows:

    ```bash
    .\your_env_name\scripts\activate
    ```

    - On macOS/Linux:

    ```bash
    source your_env_name/bin/activate
    ```

Now, your virtual environment is created and activated. You can install packages and run your Python scripts within this isolated environment. Don't forget to install required packages using `pip` or `conda` once the environment is activated.

### Clone this repo

    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash

## Usage
### Configuration
Configure the package by modifying the `src/config.py` file. Adjust parameters such as file paths, API keys, or any other configuration settings relevant to your use case.

### Data Loading
The package provides a data loader module (`loader.py`) in the src directory. Use this module to load your network data into a format suitable for analysis.

Example:

```python
from src.loader import DataLoader

# Initialize DataLoader
data_loader = DataLoader()

# Load data from a news dataset
slack_data = data_loader.load_news_data("path/to/news_article_data")
```

## Utilities
Explore the various utilities available in the `src/utils.py` module. This module contains functions for common tasks such as data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis.

Example:

```python
from src.utils import clean_data, visualize_network

# Clean the loaded data
cleaned_data = clean_data(news_data)

# Visualize the network
visualize_network(cleaned_data)
```

## Testing
Run tests using the following command:

```bash
make test
```

This will execute the unit tests located in the tests directory.

## Documentation
Visit the docs directory for additional documentation and resources. The documentation covers important aspects such as code structure, best practices, and additional usage examples.

## Notebooks
